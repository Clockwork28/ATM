# ATM
A console application that simulates an ATM made as a learning project.
<br><i>Please note - all of the code was written solely by me and thus is an accurate representation of my current skills.</i>

**Upon login you can acces one of two interfaces: Customer or Admin**

Customer Functionality:

1. Deposit Cash
2. Withdraw Cash (up to a daily limit of 2000)
3. Transfer Cash to a different customer
4. Check your balance

Admin Functionality:
1. Create a new account
2. Delete an account
3. Update account's info
4. Search for an account
5. View reports (based on balance range or dates of transactions)


All informations (Accounts List, Records of transactions, Usage of daily withdraw limit and Admin's Credentials) are stored in seperate text files encrypted and later decrypted with a simple Ceasar Cypher.


## Key Skills Demonstrated

1. **Object-Oriented Programming**: Effective use of classes and objects to model ATM accounts and operations.

2. **File I/O Operations**: Implemented reading from and writing to files for data persistence.

3. **Basic Data Security**: Created simple encryption and decryption methods for sensitive information.

4. **User Interface Design**: Developed an interactive console-based menu system.

5. **Error Handling**: Implemented try-catch blocks to manage potential runtime errors.

6. **Control Structures**: Effective use of loops and conditional statements for program flow control.

7. **Method Organization**: Code is structured into logical methods for better readability and maintainability.

8. **Data Structures**: Utilized arrays and lists to manage collections of account data.

9. **Type Conversion**: Handled conversions between string and numeric data types.

10. **String Manipulation**: Implemented custom methods for string truncation and character manipulation.

11. **Problem-Solving**: Developed solutions for complex operations like cash transfers and balance management.

12. **Authentication System**: Implemented a basic login system with multiple attempt handling.

I believe that this project demonstrates a solid foundation in C# programming and showcases the ability to create a multi-faceted application that (in this case) simulates real-world banking operations.
